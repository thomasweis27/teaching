Good afternoon, 

Thanks for finding this. I've worked on tkinter with several students, and then moved on to using this in my "Password Manager" senior capstone where I implement 
this and some cybersecurity concepts onto one system. Please check out the "Password Manager" repository if you get a chance for a full prieview of what I've been
able to do with the tkinter library. 

I think this is a fun tool to teach kids how to make 'programs' in their own pop-ups and also get them to work in something non-browser based. It's a good way for
them to begin taking charge on something that interests them and have several files each with multiple functions or classes all working together. 

Thanks, 
Thomas
