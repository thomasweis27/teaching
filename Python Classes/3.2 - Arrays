"""
Arrays: Can only store elements of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all floats).
  Generally more memory-efficient, storing elements in contiguous memory blocks.
  Ideal for numerical computations, large datasets, scientific computing, or data analysis.
  
Lists: Can store elements of different data types (e.g., numbers, strings, objects).
  More versatile, stores mixed data types, non-numerical operations.
