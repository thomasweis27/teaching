Hi there! Usually with beginners I start with the contents of the 'Python Classes' folder.

Following this, I give them choises. If they are insteresting in some games/graphics, there is the pyGame folder. 
 
    Else, we can work on Project Euler problems (math challenges) or CodeWars challenges (general programming skills).

More advanced students can explore some "Machine Learning and AI" concepts.
