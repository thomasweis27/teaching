*Only the Python Classes Folder is really full with anything. More will be updated soon.*

Hi there! Usually with beginners I start with the contents of the 'Python Classes' folder. There's a lot of good topics here but there are also some folders at I've done in classes but not necessarly help with understanding a specific topic.

Following this, I give them choises. If they are insteresting in some games/graphics, there is the pyGame folder. 
Else, we can work on Project Euler problems (math challenges) or CodeWars challenges (general programming skills).

More advanced students can explore some "Machine Learning and AI" concepts. 



*Note: many elements of code were created in classes with colaboration of students under the age of 18. All PII is removed for anonymity. Other sources used (websites, etc.) are notated within the corresponding document.*
