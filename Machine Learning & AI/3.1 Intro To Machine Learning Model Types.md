# Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised ML
  * Classification
    * **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, often used for text classification and spam detection.
    * **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based algorithm that classifies based on the nearest training examples in the feature space.
    * **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
    * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm for classification that seeks to find the hyperplane that best separates different classes.
    * **Decision Tree**: A tree-structured classifier that splits data based on feature values to reach decisions.
  * Regression
    * **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for regression that uses multiple decision trees to predict continuous values.
    * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: An extension of SVM for regression, also known as Support Vector Regression (SVR).
    * **Decision Tree**: A regression method that makes predictions by averaging the outputs from each leaf node.

### Unsupervised
  * Clustering
    * **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions data into k clusters by minimizing variance within each cluster.
    * **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Density-based clustering that groups points close to each other, identifying outliers.
    * **Principal Component Analysis**: Dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features to uncorrelated principal components.
    * **Independent Component Analysis**: Separates a multivariate signal into independent, non-Gaussian signals.
  * Association
    * **Frequent Pattern Growth**: A method to find frequent patterns in large datasets using an FP-tree.
    * **Apriori Algorithm**: Identifies frequent item sets in a dataset and helps in market basket analysis.
  * Anomaly Detection
    * **Z-score Algorithm**: Detects anomalies by measuring how far data points deviate from the mean.
    * **Isolation Forest Algorithm**: Identifies anomalies by isolating observations in a forest of random trees.

### Semi-Supervised
  * Regression/Classification
    * **Self-Training**: A method where the model trains on labeled data and iteratively labels its own data to improve.
    * **Co-Training**: Uses multiple classifiers to leverage different feature sets, often useful with limited labeled data.

### Reinforcement
  * Model-Free
    * **Policy Optimization**: Learning policies directly to make decisions based on reward maximization.
    * **Q-Learning**: An off-policy algorithm that learns the value of actions to maximize cumulative reward.
  * Model-Based
    * **Learn the Model**: Builds a model of the environment, predicting outcomes based on actions.
    * **Given the Model**: Uses a known model of the environment to plan actions that maximize reward.
