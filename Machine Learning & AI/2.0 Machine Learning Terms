*Inital terms in iD Tech lesson. Definitions were created from a variety of online searches and refined with the aid of student's clarifying questions. 

Machine Learning:
➼ Programs that learn and improve at tasks finding & using statistics.
➼ Models are built with adjustable parameters to figure out the results.
➼ Trained by 'feeding data', then comparing results to expected outcomes, and adjusting parameters.

Types of Tasks:
➼ Supervised learning: Tasks with labeled data or rewards to guide learning.
➼ Unsupervised learning: Model infers patterns and features in data independently.
➼ Classification: Separating inputs into groups.

How Models Learn:
➼ Data is fed into the model.
➼ Model's parameters process the data and return an answer.
➼ Model's guess is compared to the expected outcome.
➼ Parameters are adjusted towards the expected outcome.
➼ Process repeats with new data until model is optimized.

Model Structure:
➼ Simple models: Single variable.
➼ Complex models: Networks of thousands of 'neurons' (see below).
➼ More parameters = Can tackle more challengeing tasks, but uses more processing time.

Data and Classification:
➼ Features: Basic information underlying data points, used for classification.
➼ Labels: Data points assigned to specific classes.
➼ Loss: A measure of how often the model is wrong.

Neural Networks:
➼ Layers of neurons that process and analyze data.
➼ Neurons split data linearly, with weights determining their influence.
➼ More neurons can reduce loss but increase processing time.
➼ Layers can create more complex models with fewer neurons.

Goal:
➼ Create models with low loss (high accuracy) using as few neurons as possible.
