#This is a project developed by iD Tech and is not something that I have any ownership of. 
#Theirfore I will not be putting their classes in my personal github. It's an amazing lesson
#that uses the camera to take pictures of rock, paper, or scissors (hand gesture) and then
#trains a movdel to this. We then export the model and create a basic program to make the 
#person play against the computer (computer choice random, photos of user uses ML from pictures.)
