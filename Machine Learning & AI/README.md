Hello,

This document outlines some of the material I began teaching during my time at iD Tech. However, I didn’t contribute much to this during my tenure and have since gained a significant amount of new knowledge. While this content is primarily intended for personal skill development rather than instructional use, I’ve organized it in a way that reflects a teaching framework in case I choose to share it in the future.

I enjoy working on this, and my goal is to ensure I retain and continue to improve the Python and machine learning skills I've taught myself.

Thanks for visiting!
