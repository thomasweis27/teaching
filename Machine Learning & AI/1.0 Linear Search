"""
There are two main types of algorithems:
  Searches: looking for something in data
  Sorting: organizing elements in some way
"""

ToDo: 
1.0 Create Linear Search
1.1 Create Bubble Sort
1.2 Create other sorts maybe:
  Selection sort
  intersection sort
  merge sort
  quick sort
  heap sort
  counting sort

Other ideas: (taken from wittenberg Comp 275 class)
data types: stack, queue, union–find
sorting: insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, priority queue
searching: BST, red–black tree, hash table, k-d tree
graphs: BFS, DFS, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra
Advanced: randomness, multiplicative weights, intractability
