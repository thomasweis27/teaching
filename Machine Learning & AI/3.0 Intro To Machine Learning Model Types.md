# Types of Machine Learning
There are four main types of machine learning:

### Supervised ML
Supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data, where each data point has a known output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on this labeled data, making it well-suited for tasks like classification and regression. Supervised learning is widely used in applications such as email spam detection, image recognition, and predictive analytics.

### Unsupervised
Unsupervised machine learning is used on data without labeled responses, allowing the model to identify patterns and structures in the data on its own. This type of learning is often used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association tasks. Unsupervised learning is useful in exploratory data analysis, customer segmentation, and anomaly detection.

### Semi-Supervised
Semi-supervised machine learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a larger amount of unlabeled data, allowing the model to leverage both types for improved performance. This approach is beneficial when labeled data is expensive or time-consuming to obtain. Semi-supervised learning is commonly applied in situations like image recognition, where unlabeled data is plentiful but labeled data is scarce.

### Reinforcement
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent interacts with an environment, learning through trial and error to maximize cumulative rewards. The agent makes decisions, observes the outcomes, and adjusts its strategies to achieve long-term goals. Reinforcement learning is extensively used in areas such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles.

### Supervised ML
  * Classification
    * **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, often used for text classification and spam detection.
    * **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based algorithm that classifies based on the nearest training examples in the feature space.
    * **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
    * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm for classification that seeks to find the hyperplane that best separates different classes.
    * **Decision Tree**: A tree-structured classifier that splits data based on feature values to reach decisions.
  * Regression
    * **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for regression that uses multiple decision trees to predict continuous values.
    * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: An extension of SVM for regression, also known as Support Vector Regression (SVR).
    * **Decision Tree**: A regression method that makes predictions by averaging the outputs from each leaf node.

### Unsupervised
  * Clustering
    * **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions data into k clusters by minimizing variance within each cluster.
    * **DBSCAN Algorithm**: Density-based clustering that groups points close to each other, identifying outliers.
    * **Principal Component Analysis**: Dimensionality reduction technique that transforms features to uncorrelated principal components.
    * **Independent Component Analysis**: Separates a multivariate signal into independent, non-Gaussian signals.
  * Association
    * **Frequent Pattern Growth**: A method to find frequent patterns in large datasets using an FP-tree.
    * **Apriori Algorithm**: Identifies frequent item sets in a dataset and helps in market basket analysis.
  * Anomaly Detection
    * **Z-score Algorithm**: Detects anomalies by measuring how far data points deviate from the mean.
    * **Isolation Forest Algorithm**: Identifies anomalies by isolating observations in a forest of random trees.

### Semi-Supervised
  * Regression/Classification
    * **Self-Training**: A method where the model trains on labeled data and iteratively labels its own data to improve.
    * **Co-Training**: Uses multiple classifiers to leverage different feature sets, often useful with limited labeled data.

### Reinforcement
  * Model-Free
    * **Policy Optimization**: Learning policies directly to make decisions based on reward maximization.
    * **Q-Learning**: An off-policy algorithm that learns the value of actions to maximize cumulative reward.
  * Model-Based
    * **Learn the Model**: Builds a model of the environment, predicting outcomes based on actions.
    * **Given the Model**: Uses a known model of the environment to plan actions that maximize reward.
