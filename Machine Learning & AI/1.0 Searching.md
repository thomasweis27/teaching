# 1. Sorting algorithms. 

```
There are two main types of algorithems:
  Searches: looking for something in data
  Sorting: organizing elements in some way
```

Differnt sorting algorithms good to understand before learning ML or AI are:
* Bubble sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort

### Use the following piece of code to figure out how long it takes to run the following sorting algorithms. 


```
import time

def myFunction():
    # function to run
    pass

startTime = time.time()  # start time
myFunction()
endTime = time.time()  # end time

totalTime = endTime - startTime  # Calculate total time
print(f"Total time: {totalTime} seconds")

```
